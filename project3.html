        <h1>Life Expectancy Data Analysis</h1>
        <p>This project was developed in R, and it seeks to answer the question of how alcohol consumption, BMI, schooling, and status affect life expectancy. The dataset used was from the Global Health Observatory data repository under the World Health Organization. I built several multiple regression models to determine the best model. The null hypothesis was: Model with no independent variables fits life expectancy well enough, H0: R2=0. The alternative hypothesis was: Model with at least one independent variable better fits life expectancy than the intercept only model, Ha: R2 ≠0.</p>
        <p>Model 1 used numerical independent variables (alcohol, BMI, schooling) and life expectancy as the dependent variable.The result was F(3,2565), p<0.05, R^2=0.590. Model 2 used categorical independent variable (status) and life expectancy as the dependent variable. The result was F(1,2567)=748.8, p<0.05, R2=0.226. Model 3 used all the significant independent variables from our previous two models based on p-value (alcohol, BMI, schooling, status) and life expectancy as the dependent variable. The result was F(4,2564)=987.7, p<0.05, R2=0.606. The best model was Model 3, and its regression assumption diagnostic plots are below.</p>

        <p>The equation for Model 3 was Y=45.000 – (0.269*Alcohol) + (0.105*BMI) + (1.732*Schooling) + (4.034*Status). My findings were statistically significant at the selected alpha level of 0.05 since p<0.05. As a result, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the model with at least one independent variable better fits life expectancy than the intercept only model. Our findings can be generalized to the population since our samples passed all of the regression assumptions. The implication from my study is that alcohol consumption, BMI, education, and status of a country do affect life expectancy. As a result, countries can work on improving their population’s health by slightly decreasing alcohol consumption, increasing BMIs to a healthy level, and increase schooling. Developed countries also tend to have longer life expectancies than developing countries as expected.</p>
