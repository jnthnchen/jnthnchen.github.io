          As the saying goes, AI won't replace humans, but humans with AI will
          replace those without it. The point is that while we don't necessarily
          need to know how to develop emerging tools, we better know how to use
          them. The goal of this project is to show how to do basic data
          classification using both a rule-based approach as well as a model. A
          webpage version of the Jupyter notebook can be accessed
          <a href="spam.html" target="_blank">here</a> and a GitHub repository
          of the files can be found
          <a href="https://github.com/jnthnchen/Spam" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine being given a task to classify unlabeled text data as either
          spam or not spam. One way is to use a rule-based approach to develop
          some sort of rule where text that more closely match the rule are more
          likely to be classified as a certain something.
        </p>
        <p>
          We start with two text files, one that contains spam and the other
          non-spam. We know these text files are correctly labeled because they
          were taken from a labeled dataset. Another way we could confirm that
          it is correct is through some authoratative source like expert
          knowledge. Let's use these sample files to develop our rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we start with some initial imports and grab the top 10 most
          common words from the spam text file. To do this, we can read in the
          text file using the <span class="code">open()</span> function, count
          the number of occurrences per word using a
          <span class="code">for</span> loop ignoring stopwords, and print out
          the top 10 using another <span class="code">for</span> loop.
        </p>
        <div class="w3-center">
          <figure>
            <img
              src="images/project_17_2.PNG"
              alt="Imports and top 10 words in spam file screenshot"
              class="w3-image"
              style="border-radius: 15px"
            />
            <figcaption class="w3-center">
              Imports and top 10 words in spam file
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>Let's also do the same thing for the non-spam file.</p>
        <div class="w3-center">
          <figure>
            <img
              src="images/project_17_3.PNG"
              alt="Imports and top 10 words in non-spam file screenshot"
              class="w3-image"
              style="border-radius: 15px"
            />
            <figcaption class="w3-center">
              Top 10 words in non-spam file
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
          Instead of just using the top 10 words found in the spam file to help
          identify spam, we can find the top words present in the spam file that
          are not present in the top words of the non-spam file. These words
          would be good differentiators, in case there are words that are common
          to both files. We can do this using the
          <span class="code">np.setdiff1d()</span> function to accomplish this
          and then create a list of those words.
        </p>
        <div class="w3-center">
          <figure>
            <img
              src="images/project_17_4.PNG"
              alt="Find top differentiator words screenshot"
              class="w3-image"
              style="border-radius: 15px"
            />
            <figcaption class="w3-center">
              Find top differentiator words
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
          Now we can read in our data, remove NA values, and try to match our
          top words against the email text. First, we can create a new column of
          email that is all lowercase by using the
          <span class="code">lower()</span> method so that it will be easier to
          match.
        </p>
        <div class="w3-center">
          <figure>
            <img
              src="images/project_17_5.PNG"
              alt="Read in data and create lowercase email column screenshot"
              class="w3-image"
              style="border-radius: 15px"
            />
            <figcaption class="w3-center">
              Read in data and create lowercase email column
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
          Next, we can use that column and create another column of just the
          unique words. This way we easily determine exactly how many unique
          values of each email match the words in our top words list. To do
          this, we can create a function that splits the words and uses the
          <span class="code">np.unique()</span> function to return a list of
          unique values.
        </p>
        <div class="w3-center">
          <figure>
            <img
              src="images/project_17_6.PNG"
              alt="Create unique lowercase email column screenshot"
              class="w3-image"
              style="border-radius: 15px"
            />
            <figcaption class="w3-center">
              Create unique lowercase email column
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
          Finally we create a new dataframe called df_match of only rows that
          contain at least one match. Now we make a new column called unique
          count of matches to get the unique count of matches for each row, and
          a percent match column of the percentage match where 6/6 matches would
          mean 100%, although it's possible for percentages to be higher due to
          word variations.
        </p>
        <div class="w3-center">
          <figure>
            <img
              src="images/project_17_7.PNG"
              alt="Calculate percent match screenshot"
              class="w3-image"
              style="border-radius: 15px"

            <figcaption class="w3-center">Calculate percent match</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
          With what we have now, you can easily sort by highest to lowest
          percent matches and manually read the text to confirm whether an email
          is spam or not. The main advantage we gained here is this assistance
          in highlighting which emails are likely to be spam and which are not.
          If we compare this to a bunch of unlabeled email data, it is clear
          that labeling data using what we created here is much more efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          To train a model for classification, we can first import a labeled
          dataset. In this case, a 0 means non-spam and a 1 means spam. Let's
          name the columns as text and label.
        </p>
        <div class="w3-center">
          <figure>
            <img

            <figcaption class="w3-center">Import labeled dataset</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
          Next, we will do some text preprocessing by creating a list corpus and
          removing special characters, converting to lowercase, splitting words
          (tokenize), ignoring stopwords, and reducing to base form (lemmatize).
        </p>
        <div class="w3-center">
          <figure>
            <img

            <figcaption class="w3-center">Text preprocessing</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
          Now we will use <span class="code">train_test_split()</span> to divide
          the dataset into 2/3 train and 1/3 test. Then we will use a bag of
          words model to transform the data into numerical features (feature
          extraction).
        </p>
        <div class="w3-center">
          <figure>

          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
          Finally, we can put our train data into a logistic regression model
          and use our test data to see how it performs.
        </p>
        <div class="w3-center">
          <figure>

          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
          We can also use a confusion matrix to gauge how the model did on the
          test data. This model did fairly well at 31/33 = ~94% accuracy, but
          there are still many potential improvements. For instance, we could
          try increasing our training data. In addition, we could explore other
          models and then compare which one is best. Furthermore, we could do
          cross-validation to make the model more generalizable. If we want to
          go from an unlabeled dataset to a prediction model, we could combine
          the rules-based approach with the classification model by using the
          rules-based approach to assist in labeling, and then using the
          classification model for prediction.
